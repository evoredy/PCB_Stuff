# Welcome to my PCB Projects

I'll be adding projects here primarily done in KiCAD for anything and everything. I design small form-factor
hardware for scientific testing so expect things (but not limited to risers, boards, front-ends, drone/flight
related things, and of course car stuff.

I'll add all of my libraries and footprints as needed. I may make a seperate section for them.

To run and/or compile, you will need
    * [KiCAD]
    * [A PCB manufacturer]
    * [Imagination]
