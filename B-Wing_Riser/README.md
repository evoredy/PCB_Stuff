# Welcome to B-Wing Riser V1.0.0

The COM Express 10 specification is the smallest industrial board solution. There are ISO certified and perfect
for satellites, UAS, and automation where SWaP (size, weight, and power) are critical.

This KiCAD Package included everything to connect to a Connectech <https://connecttech.com/product/com-express-type-10-mini-carrier-board/> CCG020 COM ExpressÂ® Type 10 Mini Carrier Board (USB 3.0 Version).
This riser will relocate everything minus the HDMI/Displayport++ to the pinheaders for ease of integration.
All schematics are provided and this solution has been tested.

What you get (enough to manufacture and test)
* Gerber Files
* Drill files (inches and mm)
* Schematic
* Bill of Materials (BOM)
* Some pictures

To run and/or compile, you will need
* a Connectech CCG020
* Any COM 10 CPU Module (tested on Intel and AMD)
* A power source
* Any supported OS (boards will support booting from USB to start)

Here's what it looks like

## Changelog v1.0.0
```
  - initial release
```
## Known Issues
```
  - add KiCAD source (don't worry I hate it when people just give the gerbers)
  - add KiCAD footprints and 3d libraries for anything used
  - TODO: add microcontroller and power conditioning (not needed but would make things even smaller)
```
